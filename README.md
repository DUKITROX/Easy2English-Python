# Easy2English Desktop App

A classroom manager system, similar to Google Classroom, build entirely from scratch.

There is a desktop version for the teacher (this repo right here), and a mobile app aimed towards the student (code in this other repo [Easy2English Mobile](https://github.com/DUKITROX/Easy2English-Flutter/).

It is mainly designed for teachers of a language learning institution where they can assign homework, check for attendance and register exam marks. This app uses firebase for its database.
As mentioned before, this app goes hand in hand with my other repo [Easy2English Mobile](https://github.com/DUKITROX/Easy2English-Flutter/A) where you would have the mobile version for the student's view.

Here are some screenshots of the app itself
