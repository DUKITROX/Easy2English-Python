# Easy2English Desktop App

A desktop app designed for teachers of a language learning institution where they can assign homework, check for attendance and register exam marks. This app uses firebase for its database.


This app goes hand in hand with my other repo [Easy2English Mobile](https://github.com/DUKITROX/Easy2English-Flutter/) where you would have the mobile version for the student's view.

Here are some screenshots of the app itself
